The spat that [[@Edwards2022]] had with that other young sysop felt like something of a precursor to what the more social aspects of the modern internet would become. As the incident was a result of someone's fragile ego being bruised and they responded by using online anonymity to attack and attempt to discredit the person who bruised their ego. This is textbook internet troll behaviour and I think the only reason that [[@Edwards2022]] figured out who was responsible is that in 1992 the potential suspects were few and almost certainly local as the usage of BBSes was rather niche and constrained by telephone bills at that time as opposed to today where they could be anywhere on the planet and could possibly be a bot.
