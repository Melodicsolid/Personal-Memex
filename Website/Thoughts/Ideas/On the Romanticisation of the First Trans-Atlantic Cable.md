I find it very strange how lionized the first Trans-Atlantic cable is, with it being considered a major communications technology milestone and the first step towards modern globalization. Which is weird as it was absurdly expensive, barely functional, barely used, and broke down almost immidiately. This makes it come off more as a proof of concept or lab experiment rather than the grand achievement it is acclaimed as.
