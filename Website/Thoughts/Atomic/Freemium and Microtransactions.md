Even though the course packet [[@UMNLib2023]] mentions that business models like these are what keep services and games afloat I still hate them. I think that they are highly predatory, anti-consumer and also an easy way out of making quality games as instead a company can produce an entirely generic game according to a formula of what sells and then use freemium or microtransactions to milk it for as much money as possible and then shut it down or outmode it with a new one. These business models also prey on those who have not learned how to handle money properly such as children and teenagers, making use of the perception that video games are for children to acquire even more money.
