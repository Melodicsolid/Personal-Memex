Tully, John. “A Victorian Ecological Disaster: Imperialism, the Telegraph, and Gutta-Percha.” _Journal of World History_ 20, no. 4 (2009): 559–79.

ABSTRACT
"Until the invention of the electric telegraph, messages sent across the vast colonial empires of the nineteenth century took many months to arrive. By 1907, some 200,000 nautical miles of cable criss-crossed the ocean floors. Insulation of the cables from seawater relied on gutta-percha, a natural plastic related to rubber. Gutta-percha is all but forgotten today, but during the Victorian era it was a household word. Ironically, the high-tech Victorian telegraph industry was served by a primitive cottage industry. The gum was extracted by killing wild trees in the forests of Southeast Asia, and the scale of demand ensured that many millions of trees were destroyed. This industry brought about a Victorian ecological disaster that presaged the greater destruction of tropical rain forests occurring today."

SUMMARY
What I took from this article is that the globe-spanning empires and the telegraph systems that connected them were highly dependent on gutta-percha, which was a slow to replenish resource only found in one area of the globe. The article informs us that gutta-percha is produced within certain species of trees indigenous to Southeast Asia. The article discusses how vital this one resource was to the creation of telegraph wires as well as how there was a reliance on traditional, ineffiecient, and lethal to the producing trees. Finally, the author discusses how the ever-increasing demand for gutta-percha very nearly led to the extinction of gutta-percha producing trees.
