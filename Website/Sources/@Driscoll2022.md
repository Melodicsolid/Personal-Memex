Driscoll, Kevin. 2022 “The Birth of the Modem World.” Slate, September 7 https://slate.com/technology/2022/09/modem-world-bbs-internet-history.html.

SUMMARY
In this article the author discusses how the pre-modern and pre-web internet existed and operated. He discusses how it developed independently of ARPAnet and was constructed from bottom-up by computer enthusiasts rather than top-down by government researchers. The author refers to this early internet as 'the modem world' as it was enabed and driven by dialup modems. This early internet being designed around modems meant that it consisted of a massive patchwork of local networks rather than the all encompassing global network the web became. The author also discusses how this early internet was predominantly made up of BBSes which were personalized, privately, and personally run chat communities that catered to whatever hobby or topic that the sysop wanted them to. The author also discusses how this pre-web internet has been all but forgotten, which he thinks is a shame as he feels that learning about this era of internet history can help to recapture the sense of wonder and experimenation present in the 'modem world' which can help reshape the current web.
