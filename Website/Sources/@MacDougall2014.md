MacDougall, Robert. 'The Killer App: How the Cold War Created Video Games and Vice Versa' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_otw7hWq58A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_otw7hWq58A) (1 hr).

SUMMARY
This source is a guest lecture in which the speaker discusses how Cold War computer research and video games developed hand in hand with each other. He discusses how much of the earliest computer simulation technology was designed to simulate nuclear war. He also mentions how as soon as researchers developed computers with sceens they created "Spacewar!" which is one of the first softwares that is recognizably a video game. The lecture also discusses how much of the American plethora of preperations for nuclear war came from these simulations and how the Cuban Missile Crisis was considered eerily similar to their simulations. All in all the lecturer discusses how much of early video game technology was driven by the need for bigger and more accurate simulations and how these simulated wargames drove Cold War military directions.
