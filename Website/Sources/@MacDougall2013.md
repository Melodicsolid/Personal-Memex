SUMMARY
This chapter discusses the three competing ideas of what telephones were envisioned to be by three early pioneers in telephony. First the author discusses Gardiner Hubbard whose vision for the telephone was a means for the common American to circumvent and fight back against the Western Union communications monopoly. Next the author discusses William Forbes and his vision of the telephone as supplemental and subservient to the telegraph and only really needed by the wealthy and businesses. Finally the author discusses Theodore Vail and his vision of the telephone as a communications system connecting the entire world.
