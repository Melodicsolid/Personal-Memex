ABSRACT
Opening keynote for dLRN 2015. Delivered October 16th @ Stanford. Actual keynote may have gone on significant tangentsâ€¦

SUMMARY
The main takeaway I got from this was that the current way that people interact with the Internet is through what the author terms as the 'Stream' which consists of extremely personalized content that is rapidly disappears under the newest news and trends. The author discusses and alternative way to interact with the Internet which he terms as the 'Garden' which is a more communal vision dedicated to growing and sharing knowledge and experience. Though I also get the sense that the author appreciates the 'Stream' as it exists and for what it is but feels that without the 'Garden' the Internet is not being used to its full potential
