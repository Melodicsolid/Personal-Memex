The most powerful thing I learned in this course was how our pre-existing perceptions can influence our interactions with media technologies. The above journey supports this learning outcome from start to finish. The source [[@Müller2016]] supports this by discussing how the first Trans-Atlantic telegraph cable is frequently romanticized as the beginning of modern globalization and as a revolutionary step in global communications technology which leads to the perception that it was as reliable and functional as land based cables. This perception shapes how people talk about trans oceanic telegraphy even though the first Trans Atlantic cable was unreliable, barely functional (it broke down less than a month after its completion), and prohibitively expensive. The atomic note [[North Atlantic]] supports what I learned by noting that early global communications focusing on the North Atlantic has led to North Atlantic countries holding disproportionate amounts of global influence as much of the world's global communications infrastructure originates in places like the UK or the USA which means that these nations shape perceptions of importance via media such as international news networks which are predominantly based in the North Atlantic. The thought [[Origins and use of the Terms 'First World' and 'Third World']] illustrate this point about how perceptions shape our understandings as the existence and use of the terms 'First World' and 'Third World' logically imply the existence of the term 'Second World' but most people who do not actively look up why the term 'Second World' is no longer used are geniunely surprised to know there was a 'Second World' at all. This shows how perceptions shape how we think and speak, as the terms 'First World' and 'Third World' have become such an ingrained part of the lexicon that most people do not even think to question where the terms came from. The source [[@Gittelman2008]] supports what I learned by discussing how we tend to anthropomorphize 'The Media' and thus grant it more agency than it necessarily warrants and how this colours how we interact with news media. This ties into my idea about [[Selective Obliviousness]] in that there is a tendency to ignore things we find uncomfortable and how that affects our interaction with media such as the willingness of a great many people to ignore the evidence about climate change meaning that they are more likely to 'tune out' anything that discusses climate change. The source [[@Mak2011]] dives deeper into how perceptions shape our interactions with media, namely that the layout and contents of a page are taken for granted in Western academia and Western society. This means that few people give much thought to the importance of page layout and the placement of content on said page and how this relates to the conveying of a message. An example of pre-existing perceptions influencing how we interact with media is in my atomic note [[How the What is on the Page can Influence Perceptions]] which brings up the pre-existing perception that image heavy texts are for children which shapes how people interact with media such as graphic novels. I developed this thought further in the note [[Perception of Illustration Heavy Texts Being for Children]] in which I discuss the graphic novel MAUS which is a dark and depressing story on the horrors of the Holocaust and its effects on survivors which is presented through the medium of a comic involving cartoon animals. MAUS is very much not for kids but the medium through which the story is being told is heavily associated with children which affects how the story was recieved. This led to a further branching in my though process as discussed in my note [[The Idea that Video Games are only for Kids]] in which I discuss how the preconception that video games are exclusively for children held back further creative development of the medium for decades and continues to have negative effects as the perception that video games are all kid friendly leads to uninformed parents buying their children games like Grand Theft Auto which are very specifically not designed for children as that franchise is full of violence and mature themes. This preconception also affects societal attitudes to people who play video games professionally such as streamers or e-sports players, as even though both of these jobs are highly work intensive jobs with long hours they are still stigmatized as 'not real jobs'. The final stop on this journey is the source [[@MacDougall2014]] in which the author refutes the idea that video games are only for children even if he does not explicitly mention this preconception as he discusses how the earliest video games were designed and played by military researchers in top secret facilities at the height of the Cold War. The source also discusses how much of early video game technology was invented and optimized to serve the military's need for larger and more accurate wargame simulations. In conclusion this journey showcases how the sources I read helped me develop my thinking on the topic of preconceptions affecting our interactions with the media by discussing how preconceptions shaping how we percieve media. This led me to thinking about both graphic novels and/or comic books as well as video games as they are excellent examples of this phenomenon as they are so associated with children that their creative development was held back by the perceived need to be kid-friendly. Also because both to a greater or lesser extent are still associated with children to such a degree that children are able to access content that they shouldn't as parents who would never let their child watch Nightmare on Elm Street might let their child play Silent Hill due to preconceptions that movies can be adult-only but games are for kids.
