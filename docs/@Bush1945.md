Bush, Vannevar. “As We May Think.” The Atlantic, July 1, 1945. [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/).

ABSTRACT
“Consider a future device …&nbsp;&nbsp;in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.”

SUMMARY
What I took from this article is that Bush saw a mounting problem in that the production of scholarly work was outpacing the ability for scholars to feasibly keep up. He specifically mentions that even keeping pace in one's own field was becoming increasingly difficult, let alone being able to find requisite documents in the library. The rest of the article hypothesizes a potential solution in the form of the memex, which would function as a personal database that could be edited and shared. This would allow for much faster seraching for information and much more efficient storage.
