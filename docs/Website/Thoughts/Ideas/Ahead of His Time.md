The discussion of Theodore Vail in the chapter by [[@MacDougall2013]] made me think that he was a bit ahead of his time, as the kind of global communications network he envisioned is quite similar to the modern Internet, only the Internet is not a monopoly. Adding to this is that nationwide communication did become important over the course of the 20th century so his insistence on long-distance telephone wires, while not economically viable or culturally desired during his lifetime did transform the nature of national identity among other things. As before the ready access by the middle and working class to long distance communication as given by the telephone any relative who moved away was essentially cut off from their family during the length of time it took to deliver a letter.
