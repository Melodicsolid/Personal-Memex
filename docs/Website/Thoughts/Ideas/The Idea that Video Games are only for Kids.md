There is an ongoing and false assumption among many people and parents that video games are only for children and this assumption can be harmful for children. As the idea that by being a video game it is designed for and only played by children can lead to parents ignoring the game's rating and allowing their children to play games that they have no business playing. An example of this is Grand Theft Auto V which is rated 17+ for extreme violence (including torture), sexual themes (including the ability to hire a prostitute or go to a strip club), the presence of hard drugs (one of the playable characters is a frequent user of crystal meth), and very foul language (including many racial slurs) and has been played by a great many children as young as 7 or 8 because their parents think that it's fine because it is a video game. It can also lead to stress among adults who play video games as a hobby because people might make fun of them for it. This perception also heavily affects those who play video games for a living either through livestreaming or e-sports as they are told to get a 'real' job even though both are high intensity long hour jobs.
