One striking aspect of the [[@Tully2009]] article was how the running trend among most people regarding the destruction of gutta-percha producing trees was either downplay the severity of the problem or to actively contradict the scientific findings. The article paints a picture of short-sighted greed winning over long-term sustainability. This is nearly exactly what is going on currently regarding the climate crisis, with politicians and businessmen either actively downplaying the severity of the crisis, loudly contradicting the scientific consensus, and/or actively attacking those trying to bring attention to the crisis. A good example of this is the frankly absurdly aggressive attacks on Greta Thunberg for her vocal calls for change.
