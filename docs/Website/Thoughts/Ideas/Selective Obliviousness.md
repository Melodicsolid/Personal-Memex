The selective obliviousness surrounding how we interact with media as discussed in [[@Gittelman2008]] is quite similar to how [[@Mak2011]] argues that as a society 'The West' in both academic and other uses take the page for granted and never really stop to think about the layout and organization of a page and how it contributes to what we take away from it.

The idea of selective obliviousness also applies to the article by [[@Tully2009]] in that even though scientific consenus acknowledges climate change and that we are on the brink of a global climate crisis many actively refuse to believe this. This willful ignorance in the face of overwhelming evidence speaks to a selective obliviousness and a willingness to believe comforting lies over confronting uncomfortable truths.
