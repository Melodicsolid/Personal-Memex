The story of the Web and Berners-Lee as discussed in [[@Bory2020]] showcases how modern Western heroes are usually singular geniuses. This valourization of individual genius or achievement tends to unfortunately ignore or downplay collective effort or even just the hard work necessary to reach that one moment of glory or to make that one creation. I feel that this is a negative thing because I think it leads to people not being as willing to put in the effort to become skilled at something as the stories make it seem so easy by trivializing setbacks and emphasizing the exceptionality of the hero.
