I noticed that much of the conceptual musings on the memex in [[@Bush1945]] are caught up in the technological conventions of his era. It reminded me how many ideas about the future tend to be caught up in technological conventions at the time of writing. For example, in the original Tron movie the Grid is eye damagingly bright neon colours and black squares with neon outlines. which is not how Virtual Reality actually looks like these days.
