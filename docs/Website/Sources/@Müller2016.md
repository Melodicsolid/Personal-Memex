Müller, Simone M. “From Cabling the Atlantic to Wiring the World: A Review Essay on the 150th Anniversary of the Atlantic Telegraph Cable of 1866.” _Technology and Culture_ 57, no. 3 (2016): 507–26.

ABSTRACT
"The year 2016 witnesses the 150th anniversary of laying the first successful transatlantic telegraph cables. This review essay offers a critical rereading of existing scholarship while simultaneously suggesting new perspectives for research. Telegraphy = globalization, the history of wiring the world commencing with the Atlantic cable of 1866 seems to suggest. At the same time, this essay argues, this equation should make scholars uneasy and cautious of a possible technological determinism retracing its steps back into the middle of scholarly debates on globalization. More attention needs to be paid to whose globalization we are talking about, what the globalization of politics, markets, and media means in connection to communication, and whether the cables really started something radically new. 150 years after laying the "first" Atlantic cable, there is still room for research. New spaces, theories, and methodologies, as well as alternate user groups including women and subalterns, offer avenues to test established scholarship on global communications."

SUMMARY
This essay discusses the discource surrounding transoceanic telegraphy. It begins by discussing the romanticism surrounding the first Trans-Atlantic cable as well as the flaws in transoceanic telegraph cables. It then discusses prevailing viewpoints such as the Trans-Atlantic cable being the first step towards modern globalization, the view that global telegraphy was politically motivated, the view that global telegraphy was market motivated, and finally the view that it was motivated by both market ambition and imperial necessitity. The essay ends by noting that the issue is not closed and that other avenues of research are still open.
