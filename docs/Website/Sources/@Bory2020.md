Bory, Paolo. 2020 Chapter 2 in _The Internet myth: From the Internet Imaginary to Network Ideologies_ [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv12fw7sn.7](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv12fw7sn.7)

SUMMARY
In this chapter the author discusses how the story of how the World Wide Web came to be has been both romanticized and mythologized and how this is detrimental to fully understanding the history of the Web. This romanticization of the story of the Web frames its invention as a stroke of the individual genius of Tim Berners-Lee and his percieved sacrifice and generosity for making the Web open to all rather than hoarding what people think of as his due as the inventor, namely control of the intellectual property. The author argues that this perspective ignores that Berners-Lee built of the ideas of his forerunners and how the Web was designed to be collective to begin with. The author also discusses how the story told about the birth of the Web easily fits into the mold of the archetypal Hero's Journey myth, in that the hero leaves home, overcomes a trial to pass a threshold, enters the realm of the supernatural, completes their task and claims a treasure, returns home changed, and then shares their bounty with their community.
