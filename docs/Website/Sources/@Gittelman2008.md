SUMMARY
From my perspective this reading is about how we percieve, use and interact with media. As well as what makes 'new media' new. The author raises the point that we have a noticable tendency to give 'The Media' individual agency when discussing it even though a medium does not have agency and is more a vehicle for knowledge, viewpoints and stories.
