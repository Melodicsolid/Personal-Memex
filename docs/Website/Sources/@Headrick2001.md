ABSTRACT
"International telecommunication is not only a business but also a political enterprise, the subject of great-power rivalries. In the late nineteenth century, British firms held a near monopoly, because Britain had more advanced industry, a wealthier capital market, and a merchant marine and colonial empire that provided customers for the new service. After the 1880s, they encountered increasing competition on the North Atlantic from American, German, and French firms. Elsewhere, the British conglomerate Eastern and Associated retained its hegemony until the 1920s. Following World War I, radiotelegraphy threatened the dominance of cables. In the 1930s, cable companies were almost bankrupted by the Depression and by competition from shortwave radio."

SUMMARY
What I took from this article is that the globe-spanning was driven not just by commercial interests but also by imperial rivalries. With the author discussing at length the attempts to construct and maintain telegraph wire monopolies with more attention paid to the British monopoly. With the British fought long and hard to maintain their monopoly only to first lose the North Atlantic to the Americans follwed by the near obsolesence of telegraphy brought on by the shortwave radio.
