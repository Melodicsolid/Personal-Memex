SUMMARY
What I took from this is that as the author says in the title "The Page Matters" and that 'Western' society and academia tend to take page structure and layout for granted. That the page as a format gets taken for granted is something of a shame as things such as page layout, text style, text size, the presence of images or lack thereof, and things like footnotes can drastically change the message of a piece of text. These aspects of the page can also influence how people percieve the text.
