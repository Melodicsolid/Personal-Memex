Two great examples of how the perception that illustration heavy texts are for children can be mistaken or absurd are MAUS and the existence of the Comics Code Authority. In the case of MAUS which is a story about the author's father and his experiences as a Polish Jew during the Holocaust, it both tells his story and shows how it marked him. The book is in the format of a comic book/graphic novel in which people are depicted as various animals and as a result has been assumed to be for young children before even though the content is a non-obfusacatory telling of the horrors of the Holocaust and Nazi Europe. For the other example, the CCA was a voluntary regulatory body in the USA whose seal of approaval was all but required for a comic to be sold from the mid fifties until the turn of the century. The CCA operating under the belief that comic books were exclusively for children enforced fairly draconian and moralistic rules that rendered many comic book stories into strictly black and white good vs evil affairs in which the good guys always won. Other things the CCA banned included depicting corruption in law enforcement, excessive violence, anything remotely sexual, and the entire horror genre up to preventing the use of the word in a comic book's title This heavily restricted creativity in the medium by removing the possibility of morally grey stories that covered darker or more mature themes. The persistent assumption that comic books are for kids ignores that comic books have a huge adult following as well.
