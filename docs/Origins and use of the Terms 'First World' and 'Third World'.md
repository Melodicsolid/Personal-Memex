Especially because modern use of the terms First and Third World is incorrect. In modern English the term First World is used to denote rich and frequently European or North American countries, while the term Third World is used to refer to less wealthy and frequently African or South American countries. The origin of the terms lies in the Cold War in which First World referred to the Democratic/Capitalist bloc, Second World referred to the Communist/Socialist bloc, and the Third World referred to those countries who were non-aligned. This is extra interesting because most people these days use the terms First and Third World without even registering that First and Third imply a Second and are thus surprised that a 'Second World' existed. Which ties into what [[@Gittelman2008]] discusses about the selective obliviousness inherent in the use of media.
