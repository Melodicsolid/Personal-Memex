ABSTRACT

The paper discusses the evolution and development of library catalogues from clay tablets to the web-based catalogue. In the early stages, cataloguing was a local and individual library practice. Each library constructed its own catalogue, most suited to its purpose. A series of continuous changes through the ages, in both, conventional and non-conventional catalogues, including recent technology inputs added various features to the present day catalogue. Today the computerised catalogue may function like a portal and this function can be exploited infinitely to connect to a variety of data considered useful for library users. The system designers are trying to adopt new trends in OPACs. Web-based catalogues initiated Web 2.0 trends like RSS feeds, blogs, downloadable e-media, and instant messages. The facelift of the simple catalogue was eminent to keep up with the versatile needs of the widely web-exposed library users.

SUMMARY

From what I understand, this text gives a relatively short recounting of how library catalogues have changed over time. From the fairly haphazard clay tablet system in the Great Library of Ashurbanipal to the modern web catalogue. The author argues that library catalogues have become more efficient and standardized over time and that this is ultimately beneficial for students and scholars as it allows for more ease of access for academic sources.
