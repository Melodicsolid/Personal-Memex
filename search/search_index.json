The above journey supports this learning outcome from start to finish. The source @M\u00fcller2016 supports this by discussing how the first Trans-Atlantic telegraph cable is frequently romanticized as the beginning of modern globalization and as a revolutionary step in global communications technology which leads to the perception that it was as reliable and functional as land based cables. This perception shapes how people talk about trans oceanic telegraphy even though the first Trans Atlantic cable was unreliable, barely functional (it broke down less than a month after its completion), and prohibitively expensive. The atomic note North Atlantic supports what I learned by noting that early global communications focusing on the North Atlantic has led to North Atlantic countries holding disproportionate amounts of global influence as much of the world's global communications infrastructure originates in places like the UK or the USA which means that these nations shape perceptions of importance via media such as international news networks which are predominantly based in the North Atlantic. The thought Origins and use of the Terms 'First World' and 'Third World' illustrate this point about how perceptions shape our understandings as the existence and use of the terms 'First World' and 'Third World' logically imply the existence of the term 'Second World' but most people who do not actively look up why the term 'Second World' is no longer used are geniunely surprised to know there was a 'Second World' at all. This shows how perceptions shape how we think and speak, as the terms 'First World' and 'Third World' have become such an ingrained part of the lexicon that most people do not even think to question where the terms came from. The source @Gittelman2008 supports what I learned by discussing how we tend to anthropomorphize 'The Media' and thus grant it more agency than it necessarily warrants and how this colours how we interact with news media. This ties into my idea about Selective Obliviousness in that there is a tendency to ignore things we find uncomfortable and how that affects our interaction with media such as the willingness of a great many people to ignore the evidence about climate change meaning that they are more likely to 'tune out' anything that discusses climate change. The source @Mak2011 dives deeper into how perceptions shape our interactions with media, namely that the layout and contents of a page are taken for granted in Western academia and Western society. This means that few people give much thought to the importance of page layout and the placement of content on said page and how this relates to the conveying of a message. An example of pre-existing perceptions influencing how we interact with media is in my atomic note How the What is on the Page can Influence Perceptions which brings up the pre-existing perception that image heavy texts are for children which shapes how people interact with media such as graphic novels. I developed this thought further in the note Perception of Illustration Heavy Texts Being for Children in which I discuss the graphic novel MAUS which is a dark and depressing story on the horrors of the Holocaust and its effects on survivors which is presented through the medium of a comic involving cartoon animals. MAUS is very much not for kids but the medium through which the story is being told is heavily associated with children which affects how the story was recieved. This led to a further branching in my though process as discussed in my note The Idea that Video Games are only for Kids in which I discuss how the preconception that video games are exclusively for children held back further creative development of the medium for decades and continues to have negative effects as the perception that video games are all kid friendly leads to uninformed parents buying their children games like Grand Theft Auto which are very specifically not designed for children as that franchise is full of violence and mature themes. This preconception also affects societal attitudes to people who play video games professionally such as streamers or e-sports players, as even though both of these jobs are highly work intensive jobs with long hours they are still stigmatized as 'not real jobs'. The final stop on this journey is the source @MacDougall2014 in which the author refutes the idea that video games are only for children even if he does not explicitly mention this preconception as he discusses how the earliest video games were designed and played by military researchers in top secret facilities at the height of the Cold War. The source also discusses how much of early video game technology was invented and optimized to serve the military's need for larger and more accurate wargame simulations. In conclusion this journey showcases how the sources I read helped me develop my thinking on the topic of preconceptions affecting our interactions with the media by discussing how preconceptions shaping how we percieve media. This led me to thinking about both graphic novels and/or comic books as well as video games as they are excellent examples of this phenomenon as they are so associated with children that their creative development was held back by the perceived need to be kid-friendly. Also because both to a greater or lesser extent are still associated with children to such a degree that children are able to access content that they shouldn't as parents who would never let their child watch Nightmare on Elm Street might let their child play Silent Hill due to preconceptions that movies can be adult-only but games are for kids.</p>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":""},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#the-journey-between-websitesourcesheadrick2001-and-websitethoughtsatomicgutta-percha","title":"The Journey Between Website/Sources/@Headrick2001 and Website/Thoughts/Atomic/Gutta-Percha","text":"<ul> <li>Website/Sources/@Headrick2001</li> <li>Website/Thoughts/Atomic/North Atlantic</li> <li>Website/0_Final Journey_1</li> <li>Website/Thoughts/Ideas/Selective Obliviousness</li> <li>Website/Sources/@Tully2009</li> <li>Website/Thoughts/Atomic/Gutta-Percha</li> </ul> <p>I did meet my personal goals for this course as my goal was: I would like to learn something about the history of the internet, as I love learning as a worthwhile goal in and of itself. This means that it would have been fairly difficult to fail at this goal as any new thing I learned would have fulfilled it. However, for this Final Journey I have chosen to focus on the global telegraphy network which has also been referred to as 'The First Internet'. The source @Headrick2001 taught me about how the shape and structure of the global telegraphy network was influenced by both commercial interests as well as the imperial rivalries of the time. In the thought North Atlantic I made the connection between how the influence of imperial rivalries on the shape of the global telegraphy network meant that the most robust sections of said network were concentrated in the North Atlantic and how that trend helped give the North Atlantic nations disproportionate influence on the global stage. The presence of 0_Final Journey_1 in this journey is as a relay point between two previously unconnected thoughts as my personal memex is organized less as one large web as it is organized as three smaller webs with several overlap points. As such my first Final Journey question created connections where there were previously none. In my learning about the global telegraphy network I expanded on my thought Selective Obliviousness to include environmental concerns as I learned in @Tully2009 that the telegraphy industry required gutta-percha and how this led to massive and unsustainable harvesting practices that all but rendered several varieties of tree extinct all while denying that there was a problem and ignoring expert advice. Which shows an interesting parallel with modern discourse about climate change which is full of denialism and ignoring of evidence. As I mentioned in Gutta-Percha I had never heard of gutta-percha before which is an excellent example of how I met my goal in that I learned about a whole new aspect of industrialization, a whole new resource that was ravenously extracted, and a whole new historical environmental disaster. In conclusion I learned quite a lot about the history of the Internet in this course but I feel that I learned the most about telegraphy and the global telegraphy network as before this course I was fairly ignorant about telegraphy other than it required wires and used morse code. Which is why I chose to focus on telegraphy for this Final Journey question even though I also learned a lot of fascinating things about early telephony and early telephone networks as well as about early computer networks and video games.</p>"},{"location":"Index/","title":"Index","text":"<p>My Personal Memex</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p>Sources: @kumar2013 @Caulfield2015 @Mak2011 @Gittelman2008 @Bush1945 @Quevedo2010 @Headrick2001 @MacDougall2013 @M\u00fcller2016 @Tully2009 @Bory2020 @Driscoll2022 @Edwards2022 @MacDougall2014 @UMNLib2023</p> <p>Thoughts: Atomic The Term 'Developed' How the What is on the Page can Influence Perceptions Similarities Between the Memex Concept and Modern Library Databases Wikipedia Gutta-Percha North Atlantic The British Telegraphy Project The First Web Debunking The Video Games are for Kids Myth Freemium and Microtransactions On Western Ideal Heroes The Modem World and the Garden</p> <p>Ideas Thoughts on the term 'Developed' Origins and use of the Terms 'First World' and 'Third World' Selective Obliviousness Introspective on Notetaking Perception of Illustration Heavy Texts Being for Children The Idea that Video Games are only for Kids Thoughts on the Memex as Described by Bush Thoughts on the Idea of the 'Correct Approach' Ahead of His Time Globalization On How Little Has Changed On the Romanticisation of the First Trans-Atlantic Cable The Sudden Importance of Previously Unremarkable Land Thoughts on the Internet as a Web Trolling was there in the beginning</p> <p>Final Journey 0_Final Journey_1 0_Final Journey_2</p>"},{"location":"Features/LaTeX%20Math%20Support/","title":"LaTeX Math Support","text":"<p>LaTeX math is supported using MathJax.</p> <p>Inline math looks like \\(f(x) = x^2\\).

This romanticization of the story of the Web frames its invention as a stroke of the individual genius of Tim Berners-Lee and his percieved sacrifice and generosity for making the Web open to all rather than hoarding what people think of as his due as the inventor, namely control of the intellectual property. The author argues that this perspective ignores that Berners-Lee built of the ideas of his forerunners and how the Web was designed to be collective to begin with. The author also discusses how the story told about the birth of the Web easily fits into the mold of the archetypal Hero's Journey myth, in that the hero leaves home, overcomes a trial to pass a threshold, enters the realm of the supernatural, completes their task and claims a treasure, returns home changed, and then shares their bounty with their community.</p> <p>LINKS On Western Ideal Heroes On the Romanticisation of the First Trans-Atlantic Cable</p>"},{"location":"Website/Sources/%40Bush1945/","title":"@Bush1945","text":"<p>Bush, Vannevar. \u201cAs We May Think.\u201d The Atlantic, July 1, 1945. https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/.</p> <p>ABSTRACT \u201cConsider a future device \u2026\u00a0\u00a0in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.

The author refers to this early internet as 'the modem world' as it was enabed and driven by dialup modems. This early internet being designed around modems meant that it consisted of a massive patchwork of local networks rather than the all encompassing global network the web became. The author also discusses how this early internet was predominantly made up of BBSes which were personalized, privately, and personally run chat communities that catered to whatever hobby or topic that the sysop wanted them to.

He discusses how his brother first got interested in the world of the early internet and spread that interest to him. The author spent much of his free time during this time frame visiting various local BBSes during which he befriended another young internet user. This constant browsing of BBSes eventually sparked an interest in making his own BBS. With the help of an expert he met on another BBS the author eventually constructed his own BBS and became his area's youngest sysop (system operator) which led to jealousy from the previous record holder who he thought he had befriended. This led to his BBS being hacked, but not deterred the author remade it in a more secure fashion and ran it for around 5 more years. The author ends his recollection by discussing how he eventually ended up remaking the BBS in a form that is more friendly to the modern internet and has been running it since thus meaning that the new one has run for longer than the original.</p> <p>LINKS Trolling was there in the beginning</p>"},{"location":"Website/Sources/%40Gittelman2008/","title":"@Gittelman2008","text":"<p>\u201cGitelman.Pdf.\u201d Accessed February 8, 2023. http://web.mit.edu/uricchio/Public/television/Gitelman.pdf.</p> <p>SUMMARY From my perspective this reading is about how we percieve, use and interact with media.

In the late nineteenth century, British firms held a near monopoly, because Britain had more advanced industry, a wealthier capital market, and a merchant marine and colonial empire that provided customers for the new service. After the 1880s, they encountered increasing competition on the North Atlantic from American, German, and French firms.

He also mentions how as soon as researchers developed computers with sceens they created \"Spacewar!\" which is one of the first softwares that is recognizably a video game. The lecture also discusses how much of the American plethora of preperations for nuclear war came from these simulations and how the Cuban Missile Crisis was considered eerily similar to their simulations.

This review essay offers a critical rereading of existing scholarship while simultaneously suggesting new perspectives for research. Telegraphy = globalization, the history of wiring the world commencing with the Atlantic cable of 1866 seems to suggest. At the same time, this essay argues, this equation should make scholars uneasy and cautious of a possible technological determinism retracing its steps back into the middle of scholarly debates on globalization. More attention needs to be paid to whose globalization we are talking about, what the globalization of politics, markets, and media means in connection to communication, and whether the cables really started something radically new. 150 years after laying the \"first\" Atlantic cable, there is still room for research. New spaces, theories, and methodologies, as well as alternate user groups including women and subalterns, offer avenues to test established scholarship on global communications.\"</p> <p>SUMMARY This essay discusses the discource surrounding transoceanic telegraphy. It begins by discussing the romanticism surrounding the first Trans-Atlantic cable as well as the flaws in transoceanic telegraph cables. It then discusses prevailing viewpoints such as the Trans-Atlantic cable being the first step towards modern globalization, the view that global telegraphy was politically motivated, the view that global telegraphy was market motivated, and finally the view that it was motivated by both market ambition and imperial necessitity.

After only one year, the cable reached Senegal, and a decade later, the islands were already connected to Brazil. At a first stage the network was exploited by prestigious English and French companies which had been in charge of its construction and its technological aspects. Beyond the local socioeconomic significance this first telegraph cable had for the local society, the Canary Islands, given their geostrategical situation, became a stage for the rivalry between the European countries as regards the colonisation of Africa. Part of the communications with Northwest Africa, and with South America, had a necessary intermediate landing site on the islands. Issues regarding the ownership of the network, the control of its functioning or the possibility of its interruption were vital for the imperialist projects of Western powers in their open competition with each other. Telegraph cables are a good example of the degree of intervention to which this geographical area was subjected by industrial capitalist countries. This article analyses the way in which this telecommunications system influenced the geopolitical situation of the Canary Islands and their African hinterland. Also, it deals with the hidden fights between the European powers in their quest to hold control of this system, as well as the resulting pressure the Spanish government experienced in the pre-First World War years.\"</p> <p>SUMMARY This article discusses how the sudden importance of transoceanic cables to the maintenence of colonial empires led to fairly aggressive negotiations regarding the rights for setting and landing cables. Much of this aggression was due to the national security need for communications not beholden to foreign powers. This need for colonial telegraph networks and the economic and physical practicalities of laying transoceanic cables meant that the Canary Islands which are a group of islands owned by Spain of the northwest coast of Africa and the Azores owned by Portugal in the Atlantic became the site of intense jockeying for rights and influence as they were ideal relay stations.</p> <p>LINKS The Sudden Importance of Previously Unremarkable Land The British Telegraphy Project North Atlantic</p>"},{"location":"Website/Sources/%40Tully2009/","title":"@Tully2009","text":"<p>Tully, John. \u201cA Victorian Ecological Disaster: Imperialism, the Telegraph, and Gutta-Percha.\u201d Journal of World History 20, no. 4 (2009): 559\u201379.</p> <p>ABSTRACT \"Until the invention of the electric telegraph, messages sent across the vast colonial empires of the nineteenth century took many months to arrive. By 1907, some 200,000 nautical miles of cable criss-crossed the ocean floors. Insulation of the cables from seawater relied on gutta-percha, a natural plastic related to rubber. Gutta-percha is all but forgotten today, but during the Victorian era it was a household word. Ironically, the high-tech Victorian telegraph industry was served by a primitive cottage industry. The gum was extracted by killing wild trees in the forests of Southeast Asia, and the scale of demand ensured that many millions of trees were destroyed. This industry brought about a Victorian ecological disaster that presaged the greater destruction of tropical rain forests occurring today.\"</p> <p>SUMMARY What I took from this article is that the globe-spanning empires and the telegraph systems that connected them were highly dependent on gutta-percha, which was a slow to replenish resource only found in one area of the globe. The article informs us that gutta-percha is produced within certain species of trees indigenous to Southeast Asia. The article discusses how vital this one resource was to the creation of telegraph wires as well as how there was a reliance on traditional, ineffiecient, and lethal to the producing trees. Finally, the author discusses how the ever-increasing demand for gutta-percha very nearly led to the extinction of gutta-percha producing trees.</p> <p>LINKS Gutta-Percha On How Little Has Changed Selective Obliviousness</p>"},{"location":"Website/Sources/%40UMNLib2023/","title":"@UMNLib2023","text":"<p>\u201c11.2 The Evolution of the Internet \u2013 Understanding Media and Culture.\u201d Accessed April  12, 2023.\u00a0https://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture/chapter/11-2-the-evolution-of-the-internet/.</p> <p>SUMMARY This learning packet discusses the history of the internet from the Cold War to the Social Media era with a focus on the decentralized nature of the internet as well as how rules or 'protocols' shape how we engage with the internet. The packet discusses how decentralization was built into the early internet due to Cold War fears of nuclear war as the previous American communications system of a single hub with many connections was vulnerable to a strike destroying said hub. While the decentralized system used by the internet allowed for message transmission even if parts of the network were destroyed as the messages had multiple paths to their destination. What makes this decentralized system work is a set of standardized protocols programmed into the system governing how and in what ways networked computers communicate. The other thing I got out of this course packet is that the majority of digital business models require a diversified group of income sources lest they hemorrhage money. This is one of the things driving the proliferation of business models like the freemium model in which one can use the service for free but without paying one only has access to the barest of minimums, as well as the microtransaction model which is more common in video games. The microtransactio model is one in which the game is generally entirely free but has an ingame store where one can spend generally small amounts of money in order to acquire cosmetics or in some games for convenience enabling items such as quicker completion of tasks.</p> <p>LINKS Freemium and Microtransactions The Idea that Video Games are only for Kids Debunking The Video Games are for Kids Myth</p>"},{"location":"Website/Sources/%40kumar2013/","title":"@kumar2013","text":"<p>Shiv Kumar, Shiv Kumar. \u201cFrom Clay Tablets to Web: Journey of Library Catalogue.\u201d DESIDOC Journal of Library &amp; Information Technology 33, no. 1 (January 1, 2013): 45\u201354. https://doi.org/10.14429/djlit.33.1.3729.</p> <p>ABSTRACT</p> <p>The paper discusses the evolution and development of library catalogues from clay tablets to the web-based catalogue. In the early stages, cataloguing was a local and individual library practice. Each library constructed its own catalogue, most suited to its purpose. A series of continuous changes through the ages, in both, conventional and non-conventional catalogues, including recent technology inputs added various features to the present day catalogue. Today the computerised catalogue may function like a portal and this function can be exploited infinitely to connect to a variety of data considered useful for library users. The system designers are trying to adopt new trends in OPACs. Web-based catalogues initiated Web 2.0 trends like RSS feeds, blogs, downloadable e-media, and instant messages. The facelift of the simple catalogue was eminent to keep up with the versatile needs of the widely web-exposed library users.</p> <p>SUMMARY</p> <p>From what I understand, this text gives a relatively short recounting of how library catalogues have changed over time.

The CCA operating under the belief that comic books were exclusively for children enforced fairly draconian and moralistic rules that rendered many comic book stories into strictly black and white good vs evil affairs in which the good guys always won. Other things the CCA banned included depicting corruption in law enforcement, excessive violence, anything remotely sexual, and the entire horror genre up to preventing the use of the word in a comic book's title This heavily restricted creativity in the medium by removing the possibility of morally grey stories that covered darker or more mature themes.
